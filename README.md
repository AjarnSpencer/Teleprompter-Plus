# Teleprompter Plus
Build standalone cross-platform instances of our Teleprompter using Electron.

Introduction
-------------
"Teleprompter Plus" is a professional grade, multi-platform, free software teleprompter for anyone to use.

It's built with web technologies so anyone can customize it to their needs. It may be run on a web browser or as a standalone application for additional features.

Installer/Package Building Instructions
-------------

## Every platform
Make sure you have `NodeJS` with `npm` installed on your system before you begin.
One you've got npm, follow these steps in every platform, then proceed to run the corresponding platform specific command:

1. Install Git and NodeJS on your system.
2. Open a `Terminal` or `Command Prompt` at your desired build location.
3. Clone this repository and its submodules.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/AjarnSpencer/teleprompter-plus.git
```
4. Move to the root folder of the Teleprompter-Plus-Electron-Wrapper project.
```
cd Teleprompter-Plus-Electron-Wrapper
```
5. Download dependencies and submodules.
```
npm run setup
```
6. Follow platform specific building steps. If builds are successful, you should find your binaries inside the `dist` folder.

## Windows
* To build 32 bit packages: `npm run dist:win32`
* To build 64 bit packages: `npm run dist:win64`
* To build both 32 and 64 bit packages: `npm run dist:win`

## Linux and BSD
1. If youâ€™re building for Linux, depending what packages you intend to build you should install their dependencies as shown at: https://www.electron.build/multi-platform-build#linux. Commands and dependency names may vary across distributions. The following instructions assume you're using a Debian/Ubuntu derivative.
```
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y icnsutils graphicsmagick
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y rpm              # To build rpm
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y bsdtar           # To build pacman
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends -y libarchive-tools # Alternative to bsdtar
```
2. Open `package.json` in the text editor of your preference.
3. Locate the following lines:
```
    "linux": {
      "target":
```
4. Under `target`, remove all targets that don't correspond to your distribution. (For example, you would leave `deb` for Ubuntu, `rpm` for Fedora, and `pacman` for Arch.) Use `tar.gz` for any other distros and `AppImage` if you wish to create a universal, portable, Linux app.
5. Save your changes.
6. Run the command that corresponds to your operating system's architecture:
    * To build 32 bit packages: `npm run dist:linux32`
    * To build 64 bit packages: `npm run dist:linux64`
	* To build both 32 and 64 bit packages: `npm run dist:linux`
    * To build ARM7l packages: `npm install -g electron-builder` (followed by) `npm run dist:linuxarm`

## OS X
* Run `npm run dist:macos`.
